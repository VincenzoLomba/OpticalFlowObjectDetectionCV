# Optimal Flow And Object Detection CV

A simple [Python code](https://github.com/VincenzoLomba/OpticalFlowCV/tree/master/pyworkspace/Code) collection for generating optical flow (with ego-motion compensation) from a given video, along with object detection (with special focus on creating a distance profile for detected objects) relative to the same video.
